Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook file provided in the repository to follow along with the demonstration.

Mock Data Generation
Mock data is generated using Python library Faker. You can customize the mock data generation process to suit your specific requirements.

Creating Scatter Charts
How to create scatter charts in Jupyter Notebook using mock data. Scatter charts are valuable for visualizing relationships and patterns within data points.

Creating Pie Charts
Discover how to create pie charts in Jupyter Notebook using mock data. Pie charts are effective for showing data distribution among categories or types.

Why Use Mock Data for Visualization
Mock data serves several purposes in data visualization:

Prototyping: Use mock data to quickly prototype and test visualizations before applying them to real data.
Privacy: When real data contains sensitive information, mock data allows you to share visualizations without compromising privacy.
Education: Mock data is ideal for educational purposes and tutorials, as it can be freely shared and understood.
Demonstration: Showcase your data visualization skills to potential employers or clients by using mock data to create compelling visuals.
