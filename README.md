Project Introduction
In the world of collections, understanding and optimizing data-driven strategies is paramount. This project is designed to explore collections data, visualize key variables, and derive actionable insights. The analysis includes:

Mock Data Generation: Synthetic data for account holders, payment statuses, payment amounts, remaining balances, and more is created to simulate real-world collections scenarios.

Scatter Chart Visualization: A scatter chart is generated to visualize the relationship between payment amounts and remaining balances. This helps identify payment behavior patterns and clusters.

Pie Chart Visualization: A pie chart illustrates the distribution of debt by payment status. This provides a clear overview of outstanding balances associated with different payment categories.

Key Features
Data generation with Faker for realistic account holder names.
Visualization of payment behavior clusters using Seaborn scatter charts.
Distribution analysis of debt by payment status using a pie chart.
Detailed explanations and interpretations of visualizations.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (3.6+)
